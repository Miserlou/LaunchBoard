## An Ableton Live rack to turn a LaunchPad into a Guitar

Inspired by Solomon Kimrey's [Guiboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/comments/g1yrzj/piano_schmiano/), this simple Ableton Live rack turns a Novation Launchpad into a guitar!

The bottom six rows use standard EADGBE tuning, and the two top rows add an additional AD strings. If you're like me and suck at piano but can play the guitar, this it feels very natural to use!

You can add octave controls by mapping the octave parameters to the buttons on your LaunchPad. You can use the capo knob to change the root of the scale.

Max is NOT required to use this.
