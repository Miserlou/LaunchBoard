## An Ableton Live device to turn a LaunchPad into a Guitar

Inspired by Solomon Kimrey's [Guiboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/comments/g1yrzj/piano_schmiano/), this simple Ableton Live rack turns a Novation Launchpad into a guitar!

The bottom six rows use standard EADGBE tuning, and the two top rows add an additional AD strings. If you're like me and suck at piano but can play the guitar, this it feels very natural to use!
